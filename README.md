# Recommendation_System

Recommender systems are all over the world. This project aims on going over all the options that we got and recommend what option we would like. This time the dataset chosen for the recommendation is books dataset compiled from Cai-Nicolas Ziegler. It contains 1.1m ratings for 270k books by 90k users and the ratings are on a scale from 1-10. The recommendations are based on collaborative filtering using kNN, Matrix Factorization to recommend a suitable book to the user.
